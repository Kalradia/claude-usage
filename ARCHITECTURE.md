# Architecture

Read this before touching `scanner.py`, the cost-calculation code in `cli.py`/`dashboard.py`, or the dashboard server itself.

## Data flow

```
~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl   →   scanner.parse_jsonl_file()
~/Library/.../Xcode/...                  ↓
                              aggregate_sessions() → upsert_sessions() + insert_turns()
                                         ↓
                              ~/.claude/usage.db (SQLite)
                                         ↓
                  cli.py queries   ←──────────→   dashboard.py /api/data
```

By default the scanner walks both `~/.claude/projects/` and the Xcode coding-assistant directory; missing dirs are silently skipped. Override with `--projects-dir`.

## SQLite schema (created/migrated in [scanner.py](scanner.py) `init_db`)

- **`turns`** — one row per assistant API response. The source of truth for tokens and per-model attribution.
- **`sessions`** — aggregated per session (denormalized totals + chosen primary model).
- **`processed_files`** — incremental-scan tracking: `(path, mtime, lines)`. A file is skipped if its mtime matches; if it grew, only lines past the stored `lines` count are processed.

A conditional unique index on `turns.message_id` (where non-empty) lets `INSERT OR IGNORE` cheaply dedupe replays across rescans.

## Non-obvious invariants

These three things will bite you if you don't know them:

1. **Streaming dedupe by `message.id`.** Claude Code writes multiple JSONL records per API response — only the *last* one for a given `message.id` has the final usage tallies. `parse_jsonl_file` keeps the last record per `message_id` in a dict; earlier records are discarded. Don't sum across records of the same `message_id`.

2. **Session totals are recomputed from `turns` at the end of `scan()`.** During an incremental scan `upsert_sessions` adds tokens additively, but `insert_turns` uses `INSERT OR IGNORE` against the `message_id` unique index — so if a turn is a duplicate, session totals would drift. The final `UPDATE sessions ... (SELECT SUM ... FROM turns)` block reconciles this. Preserve it if you refactor scan logic.

3. **Session primary model priority is opus > sonnet > haiku** (`_model_priority` in [scanner.py](scanner.py)). This prevents a subagent's haiku turn from overwriting the session's opus model when an existing session is updated. Per-turn model is always honored in the `turns` table; only the session-level summary uses the priority.

## Cost calculation

Costs are computed **per turn** (each turn knows its own model), then summed. This is true in both the CLI ([cli.py](cli.py) `calc_cost`) and the dashboard JS ([dashboard.py](dashboard.py) `calcCost` inside the embedded HTML). Aggregating tokens first and applying a single price is wrong for sessions that span multiple models.

Pricing is duplicated in two places that **must stay in sync**:
- [cli.py](cli.py) `PRICING` dict (Python)
- [dashboard.py](dashboard.py) `PRICING` const inside `HTML_TEMPLATE` (JavaScript)

**Cache writes are priced by TTL.** `turns.cache_creation_tokens` is the total and `turns.cache_creation_1h_tokens` the 1-hour-TTL portion (from `usage.cache_creation.ephemeral_1h_input_tokens`; 0 for older logs without the breakdown). `calc_cost` / `calcCost` bill the remainder at `cache_write` (the 5-minute rate, 1.25x input) and the 1-hour portion at 2x `input` — derived, so there's no third rate to keep in sync. Every cost call site must pass the 1-hour argument; `TestCalcCostCallSites` fails if a dashboard call omits it. DBs from before the column existed are backfilled once by `_backfill_cache_1h` (gated by the `cache_1h_backfill_done` marker in `schema_meta`).

`get_pricing` / `getPricing` resolve in three tiers: exact match → `startswith` (handles date-suffixed model IDs like `claude-opus-4-7-20260215`) → substring fallback on `opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku`. Models that don't match any tier return `None` and are billed at $0 (shown as `n/a`) — this is intentional so local/3rd-party models (gemma, glm, etc.) aren't charged at Sonnet rates.

## Dashboard server

`http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler`-based, two endpoints:
- `GET /api/data` → JSON snapshot from `get_dashboard_data()`. Returns *all* history; client-side filters by date range and model.
- `POST /api/rescan` → deletes the DB and runs a full rescan. Passes `db_path` and `projects_dirs` explicitly so tests that monkey-patch the module globals work — scan's default arg values are frozen at def time, so don't switch to bare defaults.

The entire UI lives in `HTML_TEMPLATE` as a raw string. Chart.js is loaded from CDN.

Client-side UI state (collapsed sections, the 24h update-check cache) is kept in **`localStorage`**, which is keyed by the page's origin. In the VS Code extension the dashboard is embedded as an **iframe at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/`**, so that state only survives a window reload if the port is stable. The extension therefore remembers the last port in `workspaceState` and reuses it when it's still free (`resolveStablePort` in [vscode-extension/src/port-allocator.ts](vscode-extension/src/port-allocator.ts)) — don't revert that to a fresh `pickFreePort` every launch, or the panel silently loses its state each reload.
